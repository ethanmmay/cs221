### Simple Test On How to Use Onyx to Submit Files

### GridMonitor Project Documentation and Thought -

I connected my classes by implementing GridMonitorInterface through GridMonitor and then added the functions called in GridMonitorInterface to the GridMonitor Class and built them out there.

I was able to complete the first three functions by the deadline, but couldn't figure out the Delta and Danger functions in time.

I noticed on our student-created discord, a lot of my peers mentioned also having trouble and not quite understanding all of the code we were provided.

It seems even after connecting the files, a large amount of sample test files are not working. I can't tell if it's due to the sample functions needing to compare themself to functions I am supposed to build, or if I have connected these files incorrectly.

Looking back, I would have enjoyed some stepping stone assignments that help review the previous Computer Science class as well as prep for the current class.
